Hello World in Python
---------------------

[![Build Status for Hello World in Python][build-status]][build-log]

This project contains a simple ["Hello, World!" program] written in [Python].

The program prints "Hello, World!" and exits.

It is under [CI] through [GitHub Actions].


## Compiling and running

To run the program use the following command:

	python src/hello.py

You should see the following on the screen:

	Hello, World!

There is also a version of the hello world implemented
in two separate files, with a library and a main program file.
Run it with:

	python src/hellomain.py

To run the tests, use pytest like so:

	PYTHONPATH=src pytest

It will detect and run doctests and unit tests.

Or run tests individually:

	PYTHONPATH=src python test/test_hello.py
	python src/hellolib.py


## Important files

* [src/hello.py](src/hello.py) --- a standalone "Hello, World!" program in Python
* [src/hellolib.py](src/hellolib.py) --- a "library" for building hello world programs
* [src/hellomain.py](src/hellomain.py) --- an overcomplicated "Hello, World!" implementation
* [test/test_hello.py](test/test_hello.py) --- unit tests to `hellolib.py`
* [Makefile](Makefile)
